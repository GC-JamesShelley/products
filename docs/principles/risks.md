## Perceived risks, and their mitigation

This section is a work in progress. Please feel free to add/amend as needed.

### Upskilling/Hiring

There are quite a lot of skills encapsulated in this design: DevOps, Kubernetes, Istio, Go/Rust, Azure/Cloud architectures, distributed applications, continuous delivery etc. A lot is expected of modern cross-functional teams.

There will probably be a perceived risk that because we don’t have those skills in house, it would be difficult to create and own such an architecture. One of Red Badger’s core value propositions is “Empower and Embed” and we will help the agency build their own capability as quickly as we can. This starts with leading by example, and we will help build teams and scale capability.

All the skills are mainstream in the industry and so the pool of talent is wider. That said it is hard to recruit great people and it is currently an employee’s market. We need to adopt these technologies in-house so that we can attract great talent. Employees today have a choice of employer and will choose organisations that are already using these principles to build microservices on top of industry standard open source technologies.

## Cost

It may be perceived that this approach is too expensive. However, embracing the cloud (if done properly) can significantly reduce the total cost of ownership of a solution. For example, the above architecture could cost less than a few hundred pounds a month (probably not even that much because enterprise agreements are in place). By using cloud and open-source software no licensing costs are incurred.

There may be a perception that the amount of work involved is greater than with a “low code” platform. However, our feeling is that while these appear to be attractive they end up costing more in licensing alone. They also get you 80% of the way there very cheaply, but the other 20% is much harder and very expensive. There is also a significant cost associated with not being in the mainstream. People are harder to recruit and cost more.

Enterprise software also “locks” the consumer in and thus the cost of change as the consumer behavior changes or there are other external regulatory or market changes becomes very high. Thus building microservices that are quick and cheap to build and easy to evolve or discard is ultimately a more cost efficient strategy.
