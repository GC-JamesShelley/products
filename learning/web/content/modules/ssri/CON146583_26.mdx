### Scenario 1

Jake Rowling, a 24-year-old man, has been taking St John’s wort because he has been feeling down ever since he broke up with his girlfriend ten months ago. He is diagnosed with moderately severe depressive illness. Jake is a keen sportsman. His medical history and physical examination are unremarkable. He does not smoke and drinks about four to six units of alcohol a week. SSRI treatment is considered suitable.

 </p>
 <p>
  The most important step is to stop St John’s wort. The supply of tricyclic antidepressants is often restricted because they are dangerous in overdose. However, once it is safe to start SSRI treatment, the supply need not be restricted because the risk of serious adverse effects with an overdose of SSRIs is low.

 <p>
  <strong className="correct">Correct</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The herbal remedy, St John’s wort has serotonergic activity and must not be taken at the same time as an SSRI. Starting SSRI treatment a week after stopping St John’s wort minimises the risk of an interaction. Close monitoring of Jake’s mood during the week allows appropriate action to be taken if his depression worsens.

  The most important step is to stop St John’s wort. Even a small dose of SSRI could pose a risk if given before St John’s wort has been adequately eliminated from the body.

  The most important step is to stop St John’s wort. However, it is important to tell Jake about agitation and gastrointestinal effects when it is time to start SSRI treatment.

 </p>
 <p>
  Jake does not drink excessively and to seek total abstinence is unlikely to be helpful. However, it might be worth mentioning that alcohol, as a depressant itself, can impede the response to antidepressant treatment. Further, alcohol taken with antidepressants can possibly affect psychomotor function, concentration and alertness.

#### When prescribing the SSRI for Jake which of the following points are appropriate to discuss?

1. To seek medical help immediately if Jake has suicidal thoughts or is reacting aggressively to routine events
2. Warn Jake that he may feel anxious and restless and get gastrointestinal side effects but these usually abate with continued treatment
3. It might take about a fortnight before he notices his mood lifting and full effect might take a month or slightly longer
4. Regardless of the SSRI chosen, the dose should be taken just once a day, always with breakfast
5. SSRIs are known to affect sex drive and Jake should seek help if this is the case

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1. To seek medical help immediately if Jake has suicidal thoughts or is reacting aggressively to routine events
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Jake’s mood should be carefully assessed for any risk of suicide or harm; close monitoring or referral to specialist mental health services may be necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2. Warn Jake that he may feel anxious and restless and get gastrointestinal side effects but these usually abate with continued treatment
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Jake should be advised that these side effects usually wear off over two to three weeks, but he should seek help if they are distressing or intolerable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3. It might take about a fortnight before he notices his mood lifting and full effect might take a month or slightly longer
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Antidepressants generally take one to two weeks to start working and it may take up to six weeks for the full effect to develop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5. SSRIs are known to affect sex drive and Jake should seek help if this is the case
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Few patients report sexual side effects spontaneously. Discussion about sexual function before starting SSRI treatment and enquiries during treatment can help Jake raise any concerns.

   4. The dose of SSRI should be taken just once a day, always with breakfast
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for fluvoxamine and paroxetine, the product literature does not recommend any specific time of day for taking the SSRI nor how to take the SSRI in relation to meals. The summary of product characteristics advises taking fluvoxamine as a single dose in the evening (but high doses can be taken as divided doses) and paroxetine as a single dose in the morning with food.

### Scenario 2

A couple of months after starting treatment, Jake is doing well and the early nausea and anxiety are settling. His mood is improving and he agrees that it is worthwhile continuing SSRI treatment. However, he is now consulting you about migraine attacks about every three to four weeks. Over-the-counter analgesics have been of some help. In addition to advice on avoiding foods and situations that can provoke migraine, you feel Jake should also have access to effective medicines.

#### Which of the following migraine treatments might be most suitable?

1. A NSAID that is specifically licensed for treating acute migraine (eg diclofenac potassium, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or tolfenamic acid)
2. A 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist (‘triptan’), preferably as a convenient quick-acting formulation
3. Tramadol with an antiemetic drug to help with the pain and nausea
4. Clonidine for migraine prophylaxis
5. Dispersible paracetamol tablets together with an antiemetic

  <strong>
   5. Dispersible paracetamol tablets together with an antiemetic
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  From the options available, this is the best one. Paracetamol is safe in this setting; a dispersible formulation can be helpful because absorption may be impaired during migraine as a result of reduced peristalsis. Addition of a suitable antiemetic drug can help to treat nausea, a feature of migraine.

  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  NSAID is not appropriate. Concomitant use of any NSAID with an SSRI increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and should be avoided as far as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2. A 5HT
   <sub>

   </sub>
   -receptor agonist (‘triptan’), preferably as a convenient quick-acting formulation
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist is not appropriate. Using a 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist during SSRI treatment introduces the risk of serotonin syndrome, a rare but very serious disorder. Drugs with serotonergic activity should be avoided in those being treated with SSRIs.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3. Tramadol with an antiemetic drug to help with the pain and nausea
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Tramadol is not appropriate. Tramadol has serotonergic effect and can interact with SSRIs and introduce the risk of serotonin syndrome, a rare but very serious disorder.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. Clonidine for migraine prophylaxis
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Clonidine is not appropriate. Clonidine can aggravate depression and sleep disorders are common adverse effects.

### Scenario 3

Jake’s depression has responded very well to the SSRI treatment. Having taken antidepressants for about 15 months, you and Jake agree that it is time to start planning withdrawal of antidepressant treatment.

#### What preparations need to be made for withdrawing antidepressant treatment?

1. Counsel Jake about withdrawal effects and advise him of the usual time course for these events
2. Consider switching to an SSRI with a long half-life during the withdrawal phase if troublesome discontinuation symptoms emerge
3. Reduce the SSRI dose over at least one to two weeks
4. Consider introducing another class of antidepressant if features of depression reappear
5. Stop SSRI treatment and start a short course of benzodiazepine to treat anxiety and insomnia

**Choose your answers as follows:**

<Expander title="If 1, 2 and 3 are correct">
 <p>
  <strong className="correct">Correct</strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1. Counsel Jake about withdrawal effects and advise him of the usual time course for these events
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Withdrawal effects can sometimes be distressing but counselling Jake about them in advance and about the time course of these reactions will prepare him better to face them, should they occur.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2. Consider switching to an SSRI with a long half-life during the withdrawal phase if troublesome discontinuation symptoms emerge
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  SSRI therapy is best withdrawn by decreasing the dose gradually. An SSRI which persists longer in the body facilitates smooth reduction of the dose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3. Reduce the SSRI dose over several days
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The SSRI should be withdrawn over at least one to two weeks; normally the dose is reduced over four weeks and, in some cases, longer.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. Consider introducing another class of antidepressant if features of depression reappear
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  If a particular SSRI has been effective, it can be reintroduced if treatment has been discontinued too soon or in case of a new episode. Introducing a different SSRI or another class of antidepressant before fully withdrawing the current SSRI runs the risk of producing a drug interaction (and serotonin syndrome).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5. Stop SSRI treatment and start a short course of benzodiazepine to treat anxiety and insomnia
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Counselling and gradual dose reduction should be the principal strategies for managing withdrawal symptoms. The introduction of a benzodiazepine introduces the possibility of dependence on another class of drugs.
