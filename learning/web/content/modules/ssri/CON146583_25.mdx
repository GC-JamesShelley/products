This self-assessment exercise comprises six questions. Please think about the single best answer for each question and then check the feedback to see if you are correct. (click on the answer to see the feedback)

**Question 1**

**Which of the following statements is correct?**

* <Expander title="The use of SSRIs is most often limited by their antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) side effects">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Although antimuscarinic effects do occur with SSRIs, they are relatively infrequent (and in some cases, negligible). Antimuscarinic effects such as blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention occur more commonly with tricyclic antidepressants.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Patients need to be warned about the possibility of anxiety when starting treatment with an SSRI">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Anxiety, agitation, nervousness, inability to sit still, and insomnia occur most frequently in the first few weeks of starting SSRI treatment. In most cases these effects subside as treatment is continued. It is important to explain this to patients before starting treatment.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Maximal antidepressant effect of an SSRI is attained within seven to fourteen days">
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  While a beneficial effect may occur within a fortnight, the full effect of an SSRI may take up to six weeks to develop
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Among the antidepressants, only SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine)">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  All SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, but this effect is not confined to the SSRIs. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor; duloxetine and venlafaxine inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and noradrenaline.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="SSRIs are generally given twice daily—first thing in the morning and late afternoon">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Most SSRIs are licensed for administration once daily; fluoxetine and fluvoxamine can be given either as a single dose or in divided doses. There is no reason for giving the second dose in late afternoon—it can be given in the evening or even at bedtime. Generally if the antidepressant is well tolerated, a single daily dose is as effective as taking it in divided doses; once-daily administration might also produce better adherence.
 </p>
</Expander>





**Question 2**

**Which of the following is NOT a characteristic adverse effect of SSRIs?**

* <Expander title="Venous thromboembolism">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  SSRIs do not generally increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. Drugs that increase platelet aggregation are more likely to cause thromboembolic effects; SSRIs in fact reduce the ability of platelets to aggregate.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Rare risk of serotonin syndrome">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Though very rare, serotonin syndrome typically occurs when an SSRI is taken with another drug that enhances its serotonergic effect or in overdose.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Erectile dysfunction">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Sexual dysfunction, including erectile disorders do occur with SSRIs. But it is important to remember that depression is also associated with changes in sexual function.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Increased gastric motility">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Nausea occurs frequently, especially when SSRI treatment is initiated; other gastrointestinal effects associated with SSRIs include vomiting, dyspepsia, and diarrhoea.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Increased sweating">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Excessive sweating can occur as a result of SSRI treatment; it can also occur when SSRI treatment is being withdrawn.
 </p>
</Expander>





**Question 3**

**The following is a selection of adverse effects of various antidepressants. Which one of these effects is specific to antidepressants that inhibit serotonin reuptake?**

* <Expander title="Dry mouth">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dry mouth can result from treatment with a variety of antidepressants; for example, the antimuscarinic effects of tricyclic antidepressants include dry mouth.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Withdrawal (discontinuation) reactions">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Although some features of withdrawal reactions might be different, withdrawal effects can occur with tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, as well as SSRIs.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and risk of hyponatraemia">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Though probably more frequent with SSRIs, hyponatraemia (often as a result of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [SIADH]), can occur with diverse antidepressants.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Anti-aggregatory effect on platelets with increased risk of bleeding">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Serotonergic mechanism is involved in platelet aggregation and this effect is therefore associated with antidepressants which inhibit serotonin reuptake.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Sleep disturbances">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Insomnia or drowsiness are associated with most antidepressant drugs. Moreover, changes in mood can also affect sleep patterns.
 </p>
</Expander>





**Question 4**

**Which of the following statements is NOT correct?**

* <Expander title="If an SSRI causes insomnia, the daily dose can be given in the morning">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Giving the antidepressant in the morning may be of benefit if it is associated with insomnia. It is also important to advise the patient about sleep hygiene (establishing regular sleep times; avoiding excessive eating, smoking or alcohol consumption before sleep time; taking regular exercise; and creating an environment conducive to sleep).
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Profuse sweating might be a sign of excessive dosing of SSRI">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Like diarrhoea and nausea, intensity of sweating may be related to the size of the SSRI dose. Sweating can also occur during drug withdrawal.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="When starting SSRI treatment, it is important to discuss the possibility of increased agitation and anxiety in the initial stages and of impaired sexual function during treatment">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Akathisia—restlessness, agitation, and inability to be still—usually occurs in the first few weeks of starting treatment and usually settles with time. Few patients report sexual side effects spontaneously and the frequency of effects such as decreased libido, impotence, ejaculation disorders and anorgasmia with SSRIs may be underestimated. Taking a history of sexual function before starting SSRI treatment can help with discussion about changes of sexual function during treatment.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Gastrointestinal side effects subside over time">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Gastrointestinal disorders are the most frequently reported effects. However, effects such as nausea and diarrhoea generally decrease in intensity and frequency with continued treatment.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="SSRIs’ effect on appetite can be of benefit for treating underweight patients">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  SSRIs are often associated with anorexia and weight loss during initial therapy. However, with continuing treatment, weight can be regained and by the end of treatment there could be an overall weight gain. Weight changes are influenced by the SSRI as well as changes to appetite as a result of improvement in mood.
 </p>
</Expander>





**Question 5**

**Which of the following statements about SSRI withdrawal effects is true?**

* <Expander title="An SSRI with a short half-life is less likely to provoke withdrawal effects after long-term treatment">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not true. Withdrawal effects are more common with SSRIs that have a short half-life and withdrawing such SSRIs may require extension of the dose reduction period.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Compared with other antidepressants, withdrawal effects with SSRIs are rare">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Withdrawal effects occur with most antidepressants; such reactions are by no means rare with SSRIs.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Occasionally it may be necessary to switch to an SSRI with a long half-life to manage SSRI withdrawal">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  SSRI treatment is stopped by decreasing the dose gradually over at least one to two weeks (normally about four weeks and sometimes longer). If withdrawal of an SSRI with a short half-life produces significant reactions, then switching to an SSRI with a long half-life may help with gradual dose reduction.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="If withdrawal effects don’t occur within 36 hours of stopping treatment, it is highly unlikely that they will occur">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Withdrawal effects usually begin within a week (typically 24–72 hours) of stopping SSRI treatment and resolve within three weeks.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Withdrawal effects typically occur only if SSRI treatment lasts longer than 24 months">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Withdrawal effects can occur after just eight weeks’ of antidepressant use. Discontinuation reactions can also occur after reducing the dose or inadvertently missing to take doses of antidepressant.
 </p>
</Expander>





**Question 6**

**Which of these statements is NOT correct?**

* <Expander title="On starting treatment for severe depression with an antidepressant drug, close observation is necessary in the initial stages to monitor for suicidal behaviour">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  NICE advises that patients at high risk of suicide or those aged under 30 years should be seen one week after starting antidepressant treatment and then frequently until the risk is very much reduced. Other patients started on antidepressants should normally be seen after two weeks and then every two to four weeks for the first three months.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Appearance of features of mania calls for discontinuation of an SSRI">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  An antidepressant should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania and it should be discontinued when the patient enters a manic phase of bipolar illness.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="To avoid rebound depression, antidepressants should be overlapped when switching from one class to another">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This can be dangerous. To avoid the risk of an interaction, enough time should be allowed for one antidepressant to be washed out of the body before another is introduced. Antidepressants should not normally be given in combination in primary care without the input of a consultant psychiatrist.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="SSRI treatment increases the risk of hyponatraemia in a patient who has suffered trauma">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Antidepressants, including SSRIs, carry a small risk of causing hyponatraemia, usually as a result of increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Factors such as trauma (especially head trauma) further increase the risk of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Appearance of confusion, diarrhoea, and exaggerated reflexes in a patient on an SSRI calls for immediate referral to a specialist">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  These features could spell onset of rare but serious serotonin syndrome, which results from excessive serotonergic effect. It generally follows the concomitant use of two drugs with serotonergic properties (eg SSRI with a 5HT
  <sub>
   1
  </sub>
  agonist or tramadol) and gives rise to symptoms such as confusion, irritability, agitation, tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperthermia, delirium and coma.
