    Antidepressants, MAOI
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>
   <p>
    Monoamine oxidase inhibitors act within nerve cells to block the enzyme that promotes breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline and serotonin. Therefore, nerve endings can release more neurotransmitter at the synapse. Examples of MAOI antidepressants include isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine. The antidepressant, moclobemide, is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type A (RIMA).

    Antidepressants, SNRI
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>
   <p>
    Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors reduce the uptake of both serotonin and noradrenaline, leaving more of the neurotransmitters at the synapse to act on the other nerve cell. Duloxetine and venlafaxine are SNRI antidepressants.

    Antidepressants, tricyclic
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>
   <p>
    Tricyclic antidepressants (with a 3-ring molecular structure) inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline by nerve endings, leaving more noradrenaline at the synapse to act on the other nerve cell. Some tricyclic antidepressants also inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. Examples of tricyclic (and related) antidepressants are: amitriptyline, clomipramine, dosulepin, imipramine, and trazodone.

    Bipolar disorder
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>

    Depression
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>
   <p>
    A psychiatric disorder characterised by lowered mood, reduced energy and decreased activity. The severity of a depressive episode is divided clinically into mild, moderate and severe subtypes (the latter may or may not have psychotic features). Repeated episodes of depression, without a history of mania, are classified as recurrent depressive disorder.

   <p>
    Dopamine receptor agonist
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>
   <p>
    A chemical substance that binds to dopamine receptors on cells, thereby triggering a response by that cell. Dopamine receptors are found on many neurones of the central nervous system, particularly those involved in motor control, pleasure and reward, memory and cognition and neuroendocrine modulation. There are at least five major subtypes of dopamine receptor: D1 to D5. In medicine, dopamine receptor agonists are given to compensate for deficit of endogenous dopamine, in conditions such as Parkinson’s disease.

    Downregulation
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>
   <p>
    Reduction of response to a substance (such as a hormone or neurotransmitter) that normally produces a particular effect. Often this results from a loss of functioning receptors in response to an excess of the substance that interacts with the receptor.

    Enantiomer
   </p>
  </th>
  <td>
   <p>
    An enantiomer is one of a pair of chemical molecules with identical molecular formula, but one enantiomer cannot be superimposed on the other because it is a mirror image of the other. Often one enantiomer exerts considerably more biological activity than the other.
