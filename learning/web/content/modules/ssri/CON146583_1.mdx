This learning module is derived largely from summaries of product characteristics (which, in turn, are based on rigorous evaluation of submitted evidence). Supplementary sources such as guidelines from NICE are used to expand on advice on managing specific risks of SSRIs; however, general advice on the management of depression and other disorders is not covered.

You should consult other resources (including evidence-based national guidelines) for advice on selecting an intervention from the range of treatment options available, taking into account the severity of illness and other clinical circumstances.

We will update this learning module from time to time.
