Temporary elevation in mood may occur because the patient feels better again. However, this needs to be distinguished from a sustained disproportionate and inappropriate elevation in mood, which may signify a manic episode.

### Factors which increase risk

In undiagnosed bipolar disorder[^1] the stimulating effect of SSRIs possibly exposes the bipolar vulnerability. In rare cases, psychotic reactions to SSRIs have occurred.

### Risk-reduction measures

When considering a patient for an SSRI, a good medical history should be taken, particularly questioning the patient about: any previous episodes of mania or mania-like features; previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder; and family history of bipolar disorder, other psychotic disorders or manic reactions in response to SSRIs. Those with a history suggestive of bipolar disorder require treatment under specialist guidance.

### Treatment

Occurrence of manic or psychotic symptoms should lead to discontinuation of SSRI treatment and urgent specialist review.



[^1]: A psychiatric disorder characterised by two or more episodes in which mood and activity levels are significantly disturbed by elevation of mood (hypomania or mania) or lowering of mood (depression); historically also known as ‘manic–depressive disorder’.
