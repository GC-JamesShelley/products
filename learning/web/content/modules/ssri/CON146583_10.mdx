![Man with muscle pain](../../assets/con132009.jpg)**Very common and common adverse effects**

Sweating may occur and in some patients can be profuse. Some patients may experience numbness or tingling (paraesthesia), pain in joints (arthralgia) or muscles (myalgia) or muscle cramps.

### Risk-reduction measures

Profuse sweating may indicate that the dose of SSRI is excessive. If symptoms do not improve, switching to another SSRI may resolve the adverse effects.
