title: 4.8. Important drug interactions
---

import Expander from '../../../src/components/Expander'

As a group, the most important interactions of opioids are with other sedating drugs and result in enhanced CNS depression. Where further sedation and CNS depressant effects are undesirable, concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided or, if this is not possible, monitor the patient for effects such as respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia, and excessive drowsiness.

Consult summaries of product characteristics and other sources for information on the interactions of individual opioids

    Avoid concomitant use of an MAOI with dextropropoxyphene, pethidine and tramadol (MAOI should be stopped at least 2 weeks before starting opioid). Preferably avoid concomitant use of an MAOI with other opioids and if used concomitantly, opioid dosage may need to be adjusted

[^1]: Class of medicines which have a sedating effect, most often used for anxiety and insomnia, but also used for muscle relaxation, managing convulsions, and as premedication for surgery and certain procedures. The class includes: chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and tempazepam
