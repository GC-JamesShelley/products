[^1]: Exaggerated sensitivity to a normally painful stimulus


[^2]: Brief, involuntary twitching of the muscles which may produce a spasmodic or jerking movement


[^3]: Feeling of dissatisfaction, anxiety and restlessness


[^4]: Constriction of the pupil of the eye, often as a side-effect of certain drugs


[^5]: Partial or complete non-mechanical blockage of the small intestine, or large intestine, or both


[^6]: Dependence is a state that develops as a result of repeated use of a certain chemical substance (eg alcohol, benzodiazepine, opioid, or even medicines for reducing blood pressure). It represents the resetting of homeostasis because of the persisting presence of the chemical substance
