She has rushed into the late clinic very concerned that her 7-year-old son Louis swallowed the last 2-mg clonazepam tablet from the blister pack soon after he got back from school around 3:30 pm. Louis had his meal before Sophie saw the pack with the missing tablet. It’s now 7:30 pm. Louis is quiet and a little sleepy. His colour is good and his blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate are unremarkable. What do you do? Choose the single best answer

* Ask Sophie to take Louis to the local accident and emergency department with a note carefully detailing the time of overdose, the medicine, and the amount taken
* Give Louis an age-appropriate dose of activated charcoal and ask Sophie to watch his breathing and colour overnight
* Call an ambulance to transfer Louis immediately to the accident and emergency department with advice to monitor his respiration and ECG while on the way
* Reassure Sophie that she need not worry and can take Louis home, keeping an eye for the next hour or so on his breathing and colour
* Telephone the UK National Poisons Information Service for guidance because poisoning in a child needs to be taken very seriously

### Question 11

Susie, an 82-year-old lady, has been in hospital receiving treatment for community-acquired pneumonia.

When you see her on the first day back, she is ‘feeling miles better’ except for ‘wooziness’ in the mornings over the last day or two. Beyond encouraging Susie to complete the course of antibiotics, how would you continue her care?

* Switch to diazepam oral solution and reduce the dose by about a tenth or an eighth every 3 days
* Prescribe prochlorperazine to help manage the unsteadiness
* Start reducing the temazepam dose after a couple of days by taking a tablet every other night and then stopping once the supply is finished
* Advise Susie to try not taking any more sleeping tablets and to have a warm milky drink instead
* Advise Susie to continue taking all the pills the hospital has given her but not to get out of bed until late morning when she starts feeling more steady on her feet
