Histamine is released when the body mounts an immune response and it is responsible for many allergy-related symptomsAntimuscarinic effectsReduction or blocking of the effects of parasympathetic nerves; antimuscarinic effects include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, blurred vision, confusion, tachycardia, constipation, and urine retentionApgar scoreThe result of Apgar test on a newborn 1 minute after birth and again 5 minutes after birth. The test evaluates skin coloration (appearance), heart rate (pulse), reflex irritability (grimace response), activity and muscle tone, and breathing rate and effort (respiration). Each of the five observations is scored on a scale of 0 to 2, with 2 being the best score.AtaxiaImpaired muscle coordination, thereby affecting the ability to maintain posture or control the strength or direction of limb movementAvoidant personalityExtreme shyness and sensitivity to rejection, resulting in social withdrawalBarbituratesSubstances derived from barbituric acid which depress the central nervous system and were formerly used mainly as sedatives or hypnotics; barbiturates in current use include phenobarbital and thiopentalCognitionMental functioning involving processes that include perception, recognition, conceptualisation, judgement, and reasoningConcordanceThe patient and the health professional agreeing on the health outcomes that the patient desires and on the strategy for achieving themDependencePsychological craving or physiological reliance on a chemical substance; also termed habituationDepersonalisationLoss of sense of personal identity, possibly accompanied by feeling that the individual cannot control own actions or speechDerealisationLoss of sense of reality with the individual’s surroundings; the external world seeming unfamiliar and unrealDisinhibitionLoss of inhibition which can lead to lack of restraint and disregard for social conventionsDiplopia‘Double vision’; a single object seen as two objectsDysarthriaDifficulty with speech caused by impaired control of muscles involved in speech because of disturbed functioning of the nervous systemDysphoriaFeeling uneasy, anxious or dissatisfiedDystoniaA neurologically based movement disorder involving sustained contraction of the affected muscles, leading to abnormal posturing or repetitive movements or bothEmbolismBlockage in an artery which obstructs blood flow, usually derived from a blockage elsewhere in the circulation.

Psychoses can result from brain injury (eg through trauma, stroke, tumours, and infection), or the use of (usually illicit) drugs, or as a result of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and mania.

     Psychotropic action
    </strong>
    The ability of a chemical substance to affect brain function, in particular those brain systems which subserve mental activity. The psychotropic action of a drug is usually (but not always) related to an ability to interact with neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.Pulmonary embolismBlood clot in the lungRhabdomyolysisRapid or excessive breakdown of muscle with urinary excretion of myoglobinSedationReduction of anxiety, irritability or excitement; inducing calmnessSleep hygieneConditions that promote sleep: eg fixed times for retiring and waking, avoiding caffeine and alcohol late at night, avoiding heavy meals at night, taking regular exercise (gentle exercise in the evening), and comfortable sleeping environmentStuporA state of mental numbness and near-unconsciousnessSummary of product characteristics (SmPC)Summary of product characteristics, a document that forms the basis of information for European Union health professionals on how to use a medicinal product safely and effectively; it reflects the data assessed for granting marketing authorisationSyncopeTemporary partial or complete loss of consciousness; a faintToleranceTolerance follows repetitive exposure to a drug, leading to a reduction of the pharmacological effect of that drugVertigoSensation of whirling or rotation of surroundings and loss of balance
