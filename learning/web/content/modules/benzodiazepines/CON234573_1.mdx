## About this learning module

Benzodiazepines are prescribed widely, mainly for the management of anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy; other indications include management of alcohol withdrawal, muscle spasm, and sedation in dental and medical procedures and in surgery. This module identifies the most important hazards of benzodiazepines and informs health professionals how to anticipate, minimise and manage the risks.

## Who should complete this module

This training module is for medical, nursing and pharmaceutical professions. It is especially suitable for clinicians at the start of their career. However, health professionals who are established in practice will also find the module a helpful refresher.

## Learning objectives

On completion of the module you will be able to:

* recognise any benzodiazepine drugs you encounter
* list important risks of benzodiazepines in general
* outline factors that contribute to the risks of benzodiazepines and how the risks can be reduced
* identify important drug interactions of benzodiazepines


## Time required

It will take you about 2 hours to complete the module. It doesnâ€™t have to be done in one sitting. You will need about 20 minutes to answer the multiple-choice questions and to check your answers against our question feedback.
