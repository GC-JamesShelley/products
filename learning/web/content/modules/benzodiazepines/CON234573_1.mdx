Our learning module on reducing the risks of benzodiazepines is derived largely from summaries of product characteristics supplemented by advice from the MHRA and other publicly available information.

The module is not designed to help you decide when to use a benzodiazepine. You should consult authoritative treatment guidelines for selecting the best treatment, taking into account clinical circumstances and the individualâ€™s views.

We will review and update this learning module from time to time. Please complete the questionnaire at the end of the module to tell us what you think of it and to pass on any comments you would like us to consider.
