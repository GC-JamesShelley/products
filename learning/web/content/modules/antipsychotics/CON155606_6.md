2.2 Children and adolescents
============================

Evidence is limited on safety and efficacy of antipsychotics in children and adolescents. Few antipsychotics are licensed for paediatric use and the range of indications is usually limited to specific conditions (eg conduct disorder). It is advisable to seek specialist opinion for treating psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.
