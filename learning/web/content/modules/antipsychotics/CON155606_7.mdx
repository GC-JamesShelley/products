This learning module discusses noteworthy risks for antipsychotics. Summaries of product characteristic[^1] and the BNF should be consulted for a fuller account of the adverse effects and warnings for individual antipsychotics.

  
The frequency of adverse effects often varies between different antipsychotics; more information is given in the discussion on individual risks

* Gastrointestinal adverse effects-including constipation, dry mouth, nausea
* Central nervous system adverse effects
* Sedation and sleep disturbances
* Extrapyramidal side effects-acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
* Convulsions
* Cardiovascular adverse effects
* Blood pressure changes
* Cerebrovascular events
* Cardiac rhythm disorders particularly QT interval prolongation
* Venous thromboembolism
* Metabolic adverse effects-including weight gain, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia
* Hyperprolactinaemia and sexual adverse effects-including menstrual disturbances, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis
* Blood disorders-including neutropenia, agranulocytosis
* Temperature regulation-hypothermia and hyperthermia
* Adverse effects on the skin-including rash, pruritus, photosensitivity
* Adverse effects on the eye-including precipitation of glaucoma, mydriasis, and pigmentation
* Antimuscarinic[^2] adverse effects-including constipation, nasal stuffiness, and urinary retention
* Dependence and withdrawal reactions
* Drug interactions-including interactions which increase adverse effects (hypotension, sedation, cardiac rhythm disturbances)
### Precautions and risks associated with special uses of antipsychotics

* Use in elderly patients with dementia-increased risk of stroke and higher mortality rate
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding-need for careful weighing up of benefit and risk for mother and baby
* Prolonged-release antipsychotic injections-need for care to initiate treatment and for correct administration technique
* Antipsychotic injections for immediate effect-need for careful evaluation of circumstances for use, use of appropriate dose, close monitoring of patient
* Clozapine-special risks include agranulocytosis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, intestinal obstruction, hypersalivation
