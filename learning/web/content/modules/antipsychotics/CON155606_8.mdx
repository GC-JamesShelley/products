![Man with a stomchache grimacing](../../assets/con146683.jpg)Gastrointestinal effects occur commonly with antipsychotics and include constipation, dry mouth, and nausea; vomiting and dyspepsia occur less frequently. Antipsychotics, particularly clozapine, can also cause hypersalivation—[see also under clozapine](/antipsychotics/CON155606_37).

Constipation and dry mouth can arise from the antimuscarinic[^1] properties of certain antipsychotics. In rare cases, ileus and consequent serious intestinal obstruction has been associated with the use of [clozapine](../../assets/con2023235.pdf).

Some antipsychotics (eg prochlorperazine) have an antiemetic action, for which they are used clinically; however, the antiemetic effects may mask organic disorders such as gastrointestinal obstruction or symptoms of overdosage with other drugs.

Oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic treatment.

### Factors which increase risk

Use of an antipsychotic with other drugs that have similar effects on the gastrointestinal system (eg concomitant use of a phenothiazine antipsychotic with an opioid analgesic or an antimuscarinic compound) increases the likelihood of gastrointestinal effects.

The risk of antipsychotic-induced constipation might also be increased by dehydration and immobility.

### Risk-reduction measures

Warn the patient about constipation and advise measures such as exercising, taking plenty of fluids, and making dietary changes.

To reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia as a complication of dysphagia[^2] (or of hypersalivation) an antipsychotic should be used cautiously in patients at risk of aspiration—[see also under Clozapine](/antipsychotics/CON155606_37)

### Treatment

Effects such as constipation and dry mouth are dose-related and often diminish on continued treatment.

Nausea frequently diminishes spontaneously within a short period. Anti-emetics that act by antagonising dopamine (such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) should be avoided because they increase the risk of antipsychotic side effects and may provoke extrapyramidal symptoms.
