Antimuscarinic[^1] effects of antipsychotics may precipitate glaucoma, blurred vision and mydriasis[^2].

Prolonged use of phenothiazines is associated with pigmentation of the cornea, conjunctiva and retina; lens opacities and potentially blinding condition of retinitis pigmentosa have been reported.

### Factors which increase risk

The risk of harm from antimuscarinic effects is increased in patients with angle-closure (‘narrow-angle’) glaucoma.

The risk of pigmentation in the eye and lens opacities is likely to increase with higher doses of phenothiazines and the duration of use.

### Risk-reduction measures

Initiating treatment with a low dose of an antipsychotic can help to avoid excessive antimuscarinic effects; the dose can be increased as tolerance[^3] develops.

Patients should be advised to report changes to eye coloration and any visual difficulty so as to identify any adverse effects as early as possible.



[^1]: Reduction or blocking of the effects of parasympathetic nerves; antimuscarinic effects include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, blurred vision, confusion, palpitations, constipation, and urine retention


[^2]: Prolonged, abnormal increase in the size of the pupil of the eye


[^3]: Tolerance follows repetitive exposure to a drug, leading to a reduction of the pharmacological effect of that drug
