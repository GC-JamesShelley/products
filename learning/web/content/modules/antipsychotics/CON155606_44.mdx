 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   i. Tourette syndrome
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Antipsychotics such as haloperidol are licensed for Tourette syndrome.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ii. Hiccoughs
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some antipsychotics (eg chlorpromazine, haloperidol and perphenazine) are licensed for intractable hiccough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   iii. Nausea and vomiting

* <Expander title="If i, ii, iii and v are correct">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   i. Paliperidone
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone, is a benzisoxazole derivative and a so-called second-generation antipsychotic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ii. Aripiprazole
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Aripiprazole is a second-generation dihydrocarbostyril antipsychotic. Because aripiprazole is a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor, it has sometimes been referred to as a 'third-generation antipsychotic'.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   iii. Clozapine
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Clozapine, a dibenzodiazepine derivative, is regarded as the prototype 'atypical' or 'second-generation' antipsychotic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   v. Amisulpride
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Although amisulpride is chemically related to sulpiride—both being substituted benzamides—amisulpride is considered to be an 'atypical' or 'second-generation' antipsychotic.

**Question 3**

**Antipsychotics can affect various physiological systems in addition to their intended target of action. Which of the following physiological systems is NOT thought to be directly affected by antipsychotics? Select the single best answer.**

**To reveal the feedback, click on the option (A–E) that you consider to be the correct one.**

* <Expander title="Bone marrow">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Rarely, antipsychotics can be toxic to bone marrow, producing anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. (The agranulocytosis of clozapine is not thought to occur by bone marrow suppression but through another mechanism).
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Spinal cord motor fibres">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Motor fibres in the spinal cord consist of the corticospinal tract which, along with the corticobulbar tract, forms the pyramidal tracts subserving voluntary movement. These neurones are not directly affected by antipsychotics.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Extrapyramidal motor system">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The extrapyramidal motor system contains elements of the nigrostriatal pathway which are directly inhibited by the D2 antagonism of antipsychotics. The extrapyramidal system is responsible for involuntary movement and the coordination of movement; inhibition of this system by antipsychotics can produce extrapyramidal side effects.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Hypothalamic temperature regulation">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Antipsychotics can antagonise the D2 receptors in the hypothalamic temperature regulation system, leading to problems with temperature control.
 </p>

* <Expander title="Pituitary hormone secretion">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Antagonism of D2 receptors in the anterior pituitary prevents dopamine-mediated inhibition of prolactin secretion, leading to risk of hyperprolactinaemia.

 <p>
  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal disorder which typically occurs within two weeks of starting an antipsychotic or altering the regimen. It is characterised by raised temperature, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and autonomic instability (eg irregular pulse, blood pressure variation, excessive sweating). Skeletal muscle breakdown can raise creatine kinase level.

 </p>
 <p>
  Catatonia is a neuromotor and behavioural syndrome characterised by rigidity, stereotyped movements, posturing and repetitive movements or actions. It is associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and severe depression or bipolar disorder. Although catatonia is possible in this scenario, given the history of recent injection of high dose of high-potency antipsychotic, another explanation is more likely.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Dystonia">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Injection of a high dose of haloperidol, a relatively high-potency antipsychotic, can produce acute dystonia, especially in an individual who has not previously taken an antipsychotic. Acute dystonia is a sustained muscular contraction, often manifesting as grimacing, rigid body posture and subjective feeling of distress. Acute dystonias are caused by D2 antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway and tend to occur rapidly, within the first days of treatment and often within hours.

 <p>
  <strong>
   ii. Oral antimuscarinic eg orphenadrine

  <strong>
   i. Intramuscular benzodiazepine eg lorazepam
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A benzodiazepine can sedate the patient and relax muscles, but it is not specific treatment for acute dystonia. An intramuscular benzodiazepine must be used with caution when a parenteral antipsychotic has been used recently, and would not be recommended in acute dystonia because breathing difficulties may result. (It should be borne in mind that absorption of lorazepam from the intramuscular injection site may be slower than absorption from lorazepam given orally.)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   iii. Oral dopamine agonist eg bromocriptine
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There has been scientific interest in the use of oral dopamine agonists for acute dystonia, but none is licensed for this use and dopamine agonists may aggravate the symptoms of schizophrenia.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   v. Intramuscular serotonin antagonist eg ondansetron

* <Expander title="Halving the antipsychotic dose">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As the patient has recently started antipsychotic therapy, she should already be on the lower end of the licensed dose range, so halving the dose in response to nausea would not be recommended.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Reassurance that nausea is likely to improve with time">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The patient should generally be advised that nausea associated with initiation of antipsychotic therapy is relatively common and usually abates within a short period (ie should improve within two weeks). Specialist advice may be necessary if the patient is finding the nausea particularly troublesome..

 <p>
  <strong>
   iii. Clozapine
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Clozapine is prolactin-sparing, but it is licensed for use only in treatment-resistant schizophrenia or when the patient is intolerant of other antipsychotics. So, it would not be recommended as second-line choice in this scenario.

* <Expander title="If all are correct">
 <p>
  <strong>
   i. Medicines
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Concomitant use of two or more medicines that prolong the QT interval could potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia; such medicines include antiarrhythmic drugs (eg amiodarone and disopyramide), macrolide antibiotics (eg erythromycin), and methadone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ii. Hypokalaemia
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Hypokalaemia predisposes patients to prolongation of the QT interval. Hypokalaemia can occur as a consequence of certain disorders or as a side-effect of drugs such as loop and thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, and parenteral amphotericin.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   iii. Congenital QT interval prolongation
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Organic heart disease such as congenital long QT syndrome increase the risk of prolonging ventricular repolarisation or of torsades de pointes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   iv. Family history of sudden cardiac death
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Patients who have a family history of sudden death may be at increased risk of QT-interval prolongation and arrhythmias.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   v. Congestive cardiac failure
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Congestive cardiac failure is among several organic heart disorders that may prolong the QT interval. Medicines such as antipsychotics that prolong the QT interval should therefore be avoided or used very cautiously in such patients.

  Tetralogy of Fallot can be caused by environmental or genetic factors. Drugs (eg isotretinoin) have been linked with this congenital heart defect but there is no convincing evidence linking antipsychotics to tetralogy of Fallot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tetralogy of Fallot comprises: (a) a hole in the wall (septum) between the two ventricles; (b) narrowing of the valve at the top of the right ventricle (pulmonary valve) that allows blood to enter the pulmonary artery on its way to the lungs; (c) mis-positioned aorta such that the blood vessel lies directly above the hole between the ventricles; and (d) thickening of the muscle around the right ventricle (right ventricular hypertrophy).

   v. Short QTc syndrome
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Antipsychotics are associated prolongation (rather than shortening) of QT interval, which represents an interference with the electromechanical function of the heart and which can lead to arrhythmia and death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Short QTc syndrome is linked to genetic factors. Its severity may vary from ECG findings with no symptoms to atrial fibrillation with recurrent syncope and sudden death

 </p>
 <p>
  Adherence to antipsychotic therapy is often relatively poor, particularly in schizophrenia. For individuals who find tablets or capsules difficult to take, adherence may be improved by switching to formulations such as sublingual tablets or oral liquids.
 </p>
</Expander>





* <Expander title="Using antipsychotic blood level monitoring as the basis for discussing adherence with the patient">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Monitoring the concentration of an antipsychotic in the blood (‘therapeutic drug monitoring’) can be of value in case of antipsychotic toxicity (particularly with clozapine) is suspected; monitoring can also reveal complete absence of drug. However, concentration of the drug in blood says little about adherence other than how much medicine might have been taken shortly before the test. Also, unless reliable pharmacokinetic data are available for the individual, it is difficult to interpret one-off results.

  Adherence to antipsychotic therapy is often poor, particularly in schizophrenia. Although there may be a temptation to ‘play down’ the adverse effects of antipsychotics, it is good clinical practice to have an open dialogue with the patient about adverse effects—this can correct misconceptions, empower and involve the patient in treatment, and promote adherence.

**Question 14**

**A 24-year-old man with schizophrenia is treated with clozapine. At a routine appointment he reports improvement in his condition. He asks if you might prescribe something for his sore throat and fever because he feels he might have got the flu. Which of the following possible effects must you particularly consider?

 </p>
 <p>
  In patients taking an antipsychotic, leucocytosis typically occurs in association with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. While neuroleptic malignant syndrome cannot be completely ruled out, another clozapine-associated effect is more likely to fit the features mentioned.

 </p>
 <p>
  Myocarditis (with accompanying fever) can occur with clozapine use (most often in the first two months) and would need to be ruled out. However, chest pain or palpitations would usually be part of the presentation. Myocarditis would not seem to be the likely cause of the symptoms mentioned in the scenario.

  <strong>
   Review the module notes and select another response
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  On starting clozapine, patients’ temperature may be raised, most often within 3 weeks. Generally the fever subsides without any intervention, but occasionally it may be associated with a serious adverse effect. In this case, neuroleptic malignant syndrome—which is characterised by high fever—would need to be ruled out. However, another clozapine-associated effect is more likely to fit the features mentioned.

* <Expander title="Agranulocytosis">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Correct
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A history of fever and sore throat suggests agranulocytosis as a possibility that must be ruled out immediately (by checking white cell count). The loss of neutrophils (neutropenia) in agranulocytosis leaves the patient vulnerable to overwhelming infection.
