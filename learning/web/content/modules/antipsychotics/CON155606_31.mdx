title: 3.12 Important drug interactions

import Expander from '../../../src/components/Expander'

Concomitant administration of an antipsychotic with a drug which is sedative (eg alcohol) or which reduces blood pressure (eg ACE inhibitor) can increase the potential for these effects.

Many antipsychotic drugs have the potential to affect heart rhythm; the risk of arrhythmia is increased when such an antipsychotic drug is combined with other drugs that affect rhythm or drugs that increase the concentration of the antipsychotic (eg azole antifungal drugs). Drugs which reduce serum potassium can increase the risk of adverse effects arising from QT-interval prolongation. The table below lists common drugs that can interact to prolong the QT interval; a comprehensive list of drugs that prolong the QT interval should be consulted where necessary.

Rarely, antipsychotics can reduce white cell and red cell count; concomitant use with other drugs that interfere with bone-marrow function (myelosuppressants) might increase the risk of reducing blood cells and, possibly, platelets.

[^1]: A substance that binds to a receptor but produces no effect and inhibits an agonist from binding to the receptor


[^2]: Extrapyramidal symptoms or side effects describe movement disorders such as acute dystonia, parkinsonian effects, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia; these effects result from disturbance—by dopamine antagonists—of the extrapyramidal system, which is responsible for involuntary reflexes and coordination of movement. (The voluntary movement system runs through the ‘pyramidal pathways’ of the medulla of the brain)


[^3]: The period between the start of the QRS complex (on an electrocardiogram [ECG]) to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with potentially very serious rhythm disorders such as torsades de pointes


[^4]: The period between the start of the QRS complex (on an electrocardiogram [ECG]) to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with potentially very serious rhythm disorders such as torsades de pointes


[^5]: Reduction or blocking of the effects of parasympathetic nerves; antimuscarinic effects include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, blurred vision, confusion, palpitations, constipation, and urine retention


[^6]: The period between the start of the QRS complex (on an electrocardiogram [ECG]) to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with potentially very serious rhythm disorders such as torsades de pointes


[^7]: A substance that blocks the effects of histamine. Histamine is released when the body mounts an immune response; also, histamine is a neurotransmitter and it regulates the functioning of the gastrointestinal system. Of the histamine receptors; histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor is involved in immune reactions, motion sickness and sleep regulation, while histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor is activated by histamine acting as a neurotransmitter


[^8]: The period between the start of the QRS complex (on an electrocardiogram [ECG]) to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with potentially very serious rhythm disorders such as torsades de pointes


[^9]: Substances that mimic effects of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. The term corticosteroids covers glucocorticoids (steroids which reduce inflammation) and mineralocorticoids (steroids which act on the kidneys to retain sodium and water and promote excretion of potassium)


[^10]: The period between the start of the QRS complex (on an electrocardiogram [ECG]) to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with potentially very serious rhythm disorders such as torsades de pointes


[^11]: A chemical substance that binds to a receptor and mimics the effect of the physiological (endogenous) substance binding to the receptor


[^12]: The period between the start of the QRS complex (on an electrocardiogram [ECG]) to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with potentially very serious rhythm disorders such as torsades de pointes


[^13]: The period between the start of the QRS complex (on an electrocardiogram [ECG]) to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with potentially very serious rhythm disorders such as torsades de pointes
