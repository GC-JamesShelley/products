4.3 Prolonged-release antipsychotic injections
==============================================

![Prolonged-release antipsychotic injection]([!--$ssWeblayoutUrl('groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con185643.jpg')--]) Prolonged-release (‘depot’) formulations of antipsychotics are administered by deep intramuscular injection and form a depot at the injection site from which the antipsychotic is released at a fairly steady rate into the blood, typically over several weeks. In the UK, an estimated 30% of patients with schizophrenia[^1] are treated with a prolonged-release injectable antipsychotic.

 Prolonged-release injections of antipsychotics may overcome poor adherence to oral antipsychotic regimens and help to improve relapse rate.

 However, use of long-acting antipsychotic injection is associated with the following disadvantages:

  * Intramuscular injection is uncomfortable and may produce injection-site reactions
 * Dose titration may be more difficult than with immediate-acting oral formulations
 * Adverse effects may persist until the drug has been cleared from its depot site
