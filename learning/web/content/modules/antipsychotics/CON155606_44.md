 **Correct**

 **i. Paliperidone**

 Paliperidone, an active metabolite of risperidone, is a benzisoxazole derivative and a so-called second-generation antipsychotic.

 **ii. Aripiprazole**

 Aripiprazole is a second-generation dihydrocarbostyril antipsychotic. Because aripiprazole is a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor, it has sometimes been referred to as a 'third-generation antipsychotic'.

 **iii. Clozapine**

 Clozapine, a dibenzodiazepine derivative, is regarded as the prototype 'atypical' or 'second-generation' antipsychotic.

 **v. Amisulpride**

 Although amisulpride is chemically related to sulpiride—both being substituted benzamides—amisulpride is considered to be an 'atypical' or 'second-generation' antipsychotic.

   
 **Feedback on other responses**

 **iv. Sulpiride**

 Although sulpiride is chemically related to amisulpride—both being substituted benzamides—sulpiride is considered to be a 'conventional' or 'first-generation' antipsychotic.

 **To reveal the feedback, click on the option (A–E) that you consider to be the correct one.**

  * [Bone marrow](# "Bone marrow")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 Rarely, antipsychotics can be toxic to bone marrow, producing anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. (The agranulocytosis of clozapine is not thought to occur by bone marrow suppression but through another mechanism).

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [Spinal cord motor fibres](# "Spinal cord motor fibres")    
 **Correct**

 Motor fibres in the spinal cord consist of the corticospinal tract which, along with the corticobulbar tract, forms the pyramidal tracts subserving voluntary movement. These neurones are not directly affected by antipsychotics.

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [Extrapyramidal motor system](# "Extrapyramidal motor system")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 The extrapyramidal motor system contains elements of the nigrostriatal pathway which are directly inhibited by the D2 antagonism of antipsychotics. The extrapyramidal system is responsible for involuntary movement and the coordination of movement; inhibition of this system by antipsychotics can produce extrapyramidal side effects.

 * [Psychomotor retardation](# "Psychomotor retardation")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 Psychomotor retardation is a reduction in voluntary movement and slowing down of thought that is usually associated with affective disorders such as severe depressive illness.

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [Catatonia](# "Catatonia")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 Catatonia is a neuromotor and behavioural syndrome characterised by rigidity, stereotyped movements, posturing and repetitive movements or actions. It is associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and severe depression or bipolar disorder. Although catatonia is possible in this scenario, given the history of recent injection of high dose of high-potency antipsychotic, another explanation is more likely.

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [Dystonia](# "Dystonia")    
 **Correct**

 Injection of a high dose of haloperidol, a relatively high-potency antipsychotic, can produce acute dystonia, especially in an individual who has not previously taken an antipsychotic. Acute dystonia is a sustained muscular contraction, often manifesting as grimacing, rigid body posture and subjective feeling of distress. Acute dystonias are caused by D2 antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway and tend to occur rapidly, within the first days of treatment and often within hours.

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [If ii and iv are correct](# "If ii and iv are correct")    
 **ii. Oral antimuscarinic eg orphenadrine**

 The treatment of acute dystonia may require antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) therapy. This may be given by the oral route or, where this is not possible, by the parenteral route.

 **iv. Intravenous antimuscarinic eg procyclidine**

 The treatment of acute dystonia may require antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) therapy. This may be given by the oral route or, where this is not possible, by the parenteral route.

   
 **Feedback on other responses**

 **i. Intramuscular benzodiazepine eg lorazepam**

 A benzodiazepine can sedate the patient and relax muscles, but it is not specific treatment for acute dystonia. An intramuscular benzodiazepine must be used with caution when a parenteral antipsychotic has been used recently, and would not be recommended in acute dystonia because breathing difficulties may result. (It should be borne in mind that absorption of lorazepam from the intramuscular injection site may be slower than absorption from lorazepam given orally.)

 **iii. Oral dopamine agonist eg bromocriptine**

 There has been scientific interest in the use of oral dopamine agonists for acute dystonia, but none is licensed for this use and dopamine agonists may aggravate the symptoms of schizophrenia.

 **v. Intramuscular serotonin antagonist eg ondansetron**

 Ondansetron and similar serotonin 5HT3 antagonists are antiemetics so would not be indicated here.

 **To reveal the feedback, click on the option (A–E) that you consider to be the correct one.**

  * [Halving the antipsychotic dose](# "Halving the antipsychotic dose")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 As the patient has recently started antipsychotic therapy, she should already be on the lower end of the licensed dose range, so halving the dose in response to nausea would not be recommended.

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [Reassurance that nausea is likely to improve with time](# "Reassurance that nausea is likely to improve with time")    
 **Correct**

 The patient should generally be advised that nausea associated with initiation of antipsychotic therapy is relatively common and usually abates within a short period (ie should improve within two weeks). Specialist advice may be necessary if the patient is finding the nausea particularly troublesome..

 Quetiapine is considered to be a relatively prolactin-sparing antipsychotic.

 **iv. Aripiprazole**

 Aripiprazole is considered to be a relatively prolactin-sparing antipsychotic.

   
 **Feedback on other responses**

 **i. Haloperidol**

 Haloperidol is relatively likely to produce hyperprolactinaemia, so it would not be appropriate for this case.

 **iii. Clozapine**

 Clozapine is prolactin-sparing, but it is licensed for use only in treatment-resistant schizophrenia or when the patient is intolerant of other antipsychotics. So, it would not be recommended as second-line choice in this scenario.

 **v. Amisulpride**

 Amisulpride is relatively likely to produce hyperprolactinaemia, so it would not be appropriate for this case.

 * [If all are correct](# "If all are correct")    
 **i. Medicines**

 Concomitant use of two or more medicines that prolong the QT interval could potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia; such medicines include antiarrhythmic drugs (eg amiodarone and disopyramide), macrolide antibiotics (eg erythromycin), and methadone.

 **ii. Hypokalaemia**

 Hypokalaemia predisposes patients to prolongation of the QT interval. Hypokalaemia can occur as a consequence of certain disorders or as a side-effect of drugs such as loop and thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, and parenteral amphotericin.

 **iii. Congenital QT interval prolongation**

 Organic heart disease such as congenital long QT syndrome increase the risk of prolonging ventricular repolarisation or of torsades de pointes.

 **iv. Family history of sudden cardiac death**

 Patients who have a family history of sudden death may be at increased risk of QT-interval prolongation and arrhythmias.

 **v. Congestive cardiac failure**

 Congestive cardiac failure is among several organic heart disorders that may prolong the QT interval. Medicines such as antipsychotics that prolong the QT interval should therefore be avoided or used very cautiously in such patients.

  **Choose your answers as follows:**

  * [If i, ii and iii are correct](# "If i, ii and iii are correct")    
 **i. Cardiomyopathy**

 Clozapine is associated with cardiomyopathy; it generally develops some time after starting treatment.

 **ii. Cerebrovascular accident**

 Antipsychotics have been associated with thromboembolic disorders; in elderly patients with dementia the risk of stroke may be increased three-fold.

 **iii. Myocarditis**

 Clozapine is associated with myocarditis; it most often occurs in the first two months of treatment.

   
 **Feedback on other responses**

 **iv. Tetralogy of Fallot**

 Tetralogy of Fallot can be caused by environmental or genetic factors. Drugs (eg isotretinoin) have been linked with this congenital heart defect but there is no convincing evidence linking antipsychotics to tetralogy of Fallot.

 Tetralogy of Fallot comprises: (a) a hole in the wall (septum) between the two ventricles; (b) narrowing of the valve at the top of the right ventricle (pulmonary valve) that allows blood to enter the pulmonary artery on its way to the lungs; (c) mis-positioned aorta such that the blood vessel lies directly above the hole between the ventricles; and (d) thickening of the muscle around the right ventricle (right ventricular hypertrophy).

 **v. Short QTc syndrome**

 Antipsychotics are associated prolongation (rather than shortening) of QT interval, which represents an interference with the electromechanical function of the heart and which can lead to arrhythmia and death.

 Short QTc syndrome is linked to genetic factors. Its severity may vary from ECG findings with no symptoms to atrial fibrillation with recurrent syncope and sudden death

  * [Use of sublingual or liquid formulations](# "Use of sublingual or liquid formulations")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 Adherence to antipsychotic therapy is often relatively poor, particularly in schizophrenia. For individuals who find tablets or capsules difficult to take, adherence may be improved by switching to formulations such as sublingual tablets or oral liquids.

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [Using antipsychotic blood level monitoring as the basis for discussing adherence with the patient](# "Using antipsychotic blood level monitoring as the basis for discussing adherence with the patient")    
 **Correct**

 Monitoring the concentration of an antipsychotic in the blood (‘therapeutic drug monitoring’) can be of value in case of antipsychotic toxicity (particularly with clozapine) is suspected; monitoring can also reveal complete absence of drug. However, concentration of the drug in blood says little about adherence other than how much medicine might have been taken shortly before the test. Also, unless reliable pharmacokinetic data are available for the individual, it is difficult to interpret one-off results.

  * [Leucocytosis](# "Leucocytosis")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 In patients taking an antipsychotic, leucocytosis typically occurs in association with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. While neuroleptic malignant syndrome cannot be completely ruled out, another clozapine-associated effect is more likely to fit the features mentioned.

 * [Myocarditis](# "Myocarditis")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 Myocarditis (with accompanying fever) can occur with clozapine use (most often in the first two months) and would need to be ruled out. However, chest pain or palpitations would usually be part of the presentation. Myocarditis would not seem to be the likely cause of the symptoms mentioned in the scenario.

 * [Neuroleptic malignant syndrome](# "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome")    
 **Review the module notes and select another response**

 On starting clozapine, patients’ temperature may be raised, most often within 3 weeks. Generally the fever subsides without any intervention, but occasionally it may be associated with a serious adverse effect. In this case, neuroleptic malignant syndrome—which is characterised by high fever—would need to be ruled out. However, another clozapine-associated effect is more likely to fit the features mentioned.

 [**Close**](# "Close")

  
 * [Agranulocytosis](# "Agranulocytosis")    
 **Correct**

 A history of fever and sore throat suggests agranulocytosis as a possibility that must be ruled out immediately (by checking white cell count). The loss of neutrophils (neutropenia) in agranulocytosis leaves the patient vulnerable to overwhelming infection.
