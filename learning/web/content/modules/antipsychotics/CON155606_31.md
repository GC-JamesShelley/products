3.12 Important drug interactions
================================

Concomitant administration of an antipsychotic with a drug which is sedative (eg alcohol) or which reduces blood pressure (eg ACE inhibitor) can increase the potential for these effects.

 Many antipsychotic drugs have the potential to affect heart rhythm; the risk of arrhythmia is increased when such an antipsychotic drug is combined with other drugs that affect rhythm or drugs that increase the concentration of the antipsychotic (eg azole antifungal drugs). Drugs which reduce serum potassium can increase the risk of adverse effects arising from QT-interval prolongation. The table below lists common drugs that can interact to prolong the QT interval; a comprehensive list of drugs that prolong the QT interval should be consulted where necessary.

 Rarely, antipsychotics can reduce white cell and red cell count; concomitant use with other drugs that interfere with bone-marrow function (myelosuppressants) might increase the risk of reducing blood cells and, possibly, platelets.
