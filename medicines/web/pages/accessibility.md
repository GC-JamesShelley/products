### Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

The SPC-PIL PDFs published on this website are created by third parties. These do not fall within the scope of the Accessibility regulations under section 4 (2) (e), which refer to ‘third-party content that is neither funded nor developed by, nor under the control of, the public sector body’.

Many of our older PARs PDFs do not meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value).

The accessibility regulations [do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018][2] if they’re not essential to providing our services.

Any new PARs PDFs we publish will meet accessibility standards.
